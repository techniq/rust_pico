#  Linker arguments
#    * `--nmagic`: turns off page alignment of sections (which saves flash space)
#    * `-Tlink.x` tells the linker to use link.x as the linker
#       script. This is usually provided by the cortex-m-rt crate, and by default
#       the version in that crate will include a file called `memory.x` which
#       describes the particular memory layout for your specific chip. 
#  Compiler arguments:
#    * `inline-threshold=5` makes the compiler more aggressive and inlining functions
#    * `no-vectorize-loops` turns off the loop vectorizer (seeing as the M0+ doesn't have SIMD)
